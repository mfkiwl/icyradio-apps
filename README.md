# icyradio-apps
This repository contains software applications targetted at the [icyradio](https://github.com/vankxr/icyradio) SDR. Despite being developed for this specifis SDR, the apps communicate with radio device(s) using the [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR) framework, so, they should be easily modifiable to work with different radio hardware.

**This repository is still a WIP**
